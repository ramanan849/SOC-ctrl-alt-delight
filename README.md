This repository contains my code, scripts and reports for the weekly assignments given by my mentors. <br>
1. **Week 1** <br>
   i. Basics of linux terminal commands, shortcuts, and technical know-hows. <br>
  ii. Had an assignment <br>
  
2. **Week 2** <br>
   i. Learnt how to create scripts and execute them. <br>
  ii. The assignment had questions, some of which were technically upgraded versions of week1 questions, while the others involved creating an interactive session on CLI using fancy ascii symbols. <br>
  
3. **Week 3** <br>
   i. Learnt about concurrency <br>
  ii. Had practice problems <br>

**From Week 4 to 8, I was asked to submit the .asm (assembly) files and the entire modified source code of MikeOS and was not told to make a report. For the last week (week 8) however, I was supposed to make a .md file to explain my answers and my NASM code for various assignments that had been provided. So, the following will include a brief** <br>  

4. **Week 4** <br>
   i. First objective - to install and run MikeOS on an emulator (QEMU on Linux); had to get the audio working <br>
   ii. Second objective - to insert custom text in the command-line of MikeOS by editing the assembly files concerning cli.asm and kernel.asm <br>
  iii. Introduction to NASM (assembly language) and some practice problems <br>

5. **Week 5** <br>
   **Learnt** how CLI commands are implemented in MikeOS CLI. <br>
   i. First task : to implement a basic command TELLJOKE that prints a joke to the terminal. <br>
   ii. Second task : to modify the TELLJOKE command implemented such that each time the command is executed, a different joke had to be printed. Here, I had to learn how **random number generation** worked in MikeOS. <br>
   iii. Third task (BOSS level) : Here, I had to further modify the already modified TELLJOKE command such that a **Musical tune** played before displaying a random joke. This involved learning how to play musical notes and upping my music skill to play a tune (I managed to a create scrawny version of the classic 'Mary had a little lamp'). <br>
   
6. **Week 6 and 7** <br>
   (It involved pretty heavy things to learn and understand, along with longer and more difficult assignments, hence this spanned over two week2) <br>
   **Understanding** memory management in MikeOS : how variables are stored, files are loaded and retrieved, Creating **SYSCALLS** by editing the kernel of MikeOS,
